0.10    2012-09-06  Released-By: SHARYANTO

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Update to Rinci 1.1.28 (transaction protocol v=2).

        - Now uses Unix::Passwd::File as the backend instead of
          Passwd::Unix::Alt. This is because UPF has working locking and gives
          detailed per-call error messages instead of using global variable.

        - Parameter name change: in setup_unix_user(), 'name' becomes 'user'; in
          setup_unix_group(), 'name' becomes 'group'. This is to align better
          with Unix::Passwd::File. Some parameters also got changed.

        - Parameter default change: default 'min_new_uid' and 'min_new_gid' is
          now 1000 instead of 0. You can of course still set it to 0.
